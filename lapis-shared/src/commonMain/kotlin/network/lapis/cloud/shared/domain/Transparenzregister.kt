/**
 * V0.5.2 §20 GwG Transparenzregister beneficial-owner tracking -- see
 * `network.lapis.cloud.server.rpc.BoardMembershipService` KDoc for the full lifecycle and the
 * legal-review flags this domain deliberately carries (Meldefiktion exception NOT modelled, no
 * automated filing to transparenzregister.de).
 *
 * [JOINED] is emitted when a [BoardMembershipDto] starts: an [network.lapis.cloud.shared.rpc
 * .IElectionService] tally seating a winner into an `EXECUTIVE_BOARD` Committee, an
 * [network.lapis.cloud.shared.rpc.IGovernanceService.addCommitteeMember] co-option into that same
 * Committee type, or an explicit [network.lapis.cloud.shared.rpc.IBoardMembershipService
 * .appointBoardMember] call. [LEFT] is emitted whenever a [BoardMembershipDto] ends: an explicit
 * [network.lapis.cloud.shared.rpc.IBoardMembershipService.endBoardMembership] call (resignation,
 * recall/Abwahl, term expiry), an [network.lapis.cloud.shared.rpc.IGovernanceService
 * .endCommitteeMembership] removal from that same Committee type, or a *displaced incumbent* --
 * a contested election (or governance co-option) seating a different member into a single-holder
 * seat (CHAIR/DEPUTY_CHAIR/SECRETARY) automatically closes the previous holder's row and emits
 * this. A re-election of the SAME incumbent into a new term does NOT emit a [LEFT] for the closed
 * prior row, only a fresh [JOINED] for the new one (see `BoardMembershipEvents`/
 * `BoardMembershipService` KDoc for the full rationale).

 * when -- not which specific Committee seated them. Kept PARALLEL to (not a replacement of)
