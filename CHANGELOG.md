## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added

**Governance** — committee/working-group management and meeting management (agenda, resolution register, minutes template, attendance tracking, quorum check); motion management for general assemblies and committees.

**Voting — three orthogonal modes**:
- **Meritocratic votes** — LTR-weighted voting on substantive/project questions.
- **Democratic elections** — one-member-one-vote for legally mandated personnel and constitutional decisions (board elections, bylaw amendments), including election board oversight, eligible-voter snapshots, candidacy management, secret and open ballot modes, and a configurable N-of-M tally-approval step.
- **Systemic consensus** — resistance-based decision-finding (Visotschnig/Schrotta method): each voter rates every option 0–10, the option with the lowest cumulative resistance wins, with a group-conflict index, configurable tiebreak rules, and an automatic "status quo" option.

All three modes share the same resolution register (`Resolution`) and reuse a single anonymous/open ballot infrastructure end to end.

**MDA persistence pipeline fully wired** — the kUML UML→ERM→Exposed/Flyway pipeline (ADR-0016, tracked as a known limitation in 0.1.0) is now the actual production persistence layer: all hand-written Exposed tables were deleted and replaced with kUML-generated code from versioned `.kuml.kts` domain models, and the Flyway baseline migration is generated from the same source of truth. Multiple real kUML gaps surfaced and were fixed upstream along the way (enum-to-`VARCHAR` type fidelity, Kotlin object-name overrides, KMP-safe UUID/date-time representations, explicit FK targeting via `fkEntity`/`fkAttribute`, a new `«Index»` stereotype for composite unique constraints) — see [ADR-0016](https://github.com/kuml-dev/kUML) for details. The project now depends on the real Maven Central `kuml` artifact (currently 0.35.0); the temporary `mavenLocal` bridge used during development has been retired.

### Changed

**English-only domain terminology.** The entire governance/voting domain, previously named in German, was renamed to English end to end (entities, tables, classes, DTOs, services, tests): Gremium→Committee, Sitzung→Meeting, Tagesordnungspunkt→AgendaItem, Anwesenheit→Attendance, Antrag→Motion, Beschluss→Resolution, Abstimmung→Vote, Wahl→Election, Konsensierung→SystemicConsensus. `README.adoc` and `docs/architecture/domain-model.adoc` were fully translated to English. This aligns the codebase with this project's own documented convention (English documentation and class names for all `kuml-dev`/Lapis repos).

### Known limitations (tracked for later versions)

- Contribution management still has no SEPA direct-debit or dunning automation (tracked since 0.1.0).
- No accounting core yet (chart of accounts, non-profit four-sphere separation, use-of-funds statement) — planned for V0.3.
- No mail-merge/PDF engine or postal-mail path yet — planned for V0.4.
- No compliance bundle yet (PartG donation-acceptance check, transparency-register reporting, GoBD audit log, backup/restore guarantee, full GDPR build-out) — planned for V0.5.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added

**Project foundation** — Gradle multi-module build (`lapis-shared`, `lapis-server`, `lapis-client`) following the Kilua RPC fullstack convention: a Kotlin Multiplatform shared module holding RPC service interfaces and domain DTOs, a Ktor JVM server, and a KVision Kotlin/JS client. CI workflow runs `./gradlew clean check` on push/PR. Persistence via Exposed ORM + Flyway migrations against PostgreSQL.

**Member management** — member master data, join/leave workflow (application → approval → active, with exit transitioning to guest status per the PZB legal-framework reference), membership tiers and roles.

**Contributions, documents, communication** — basic recurring-contribution tracking per membership tier (manual payment marking, no SEPA/dunning automation yet), a versioned document store with access tiers, and mailing-list/direct-message data models with typed Kilua RPC services.

**GDPR basics** — a self-registering `PersonalDataContributor`/`PersonalDataRegistry` mechanism so future entities opt into data-subject-access-request coverage without hand-maintaining a table list, enforced by an `information_schema`-based coverage test. Erasure requests support both anonymization (default, since accounting retention will later require it for financial records) and hard deletion where legally unconstrained, via a request → decide → execute workflow with an audit trail, exposed over both RPC and HTTP with self-or-ADMIN access control.

### Security

- Enforced the `ADMIN_ONLY` document access tier and gated version-listing/double-send paths that were previously open.
- Closed an unauthenticated member email/role leak in `listMembers()`.
- Made demo-data seeding opt-in with a guard against running against a real database.
- Fixed an ambiguous-join bug where `ErasureRequestTable`'s three separate foreign keys to `MemberTable` made Exposed's implicit join throw `IllegalStateException` at runtime; replaced with an explicit join condition.

### Known limitations (tracked for later versions)

- The kUML MDA persistence pipeline (UML → ERM → Exposed/Flyway, per [ADR-0016](https://github.com/kuml-dev/kUML) in the sibling kUML project) is not yet wired into this repo's build — Exposed tables are hand-written for now, with a kUML diagram kept as documentation only (`docs/architecture/domain-model.adoc`). Wiring the generator is tracked as follow-up work.
- Contribution management has no SEPA direct-debit or dunning automation.
- No governance layer yet (committees, meetings, motions, votes) — planned for V0.2.
