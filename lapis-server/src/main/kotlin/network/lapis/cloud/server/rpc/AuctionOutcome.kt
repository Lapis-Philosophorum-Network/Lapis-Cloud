/**
 * The englische Proxy-Bid/Second-Price auction settlement math -- see `21-auction.kuml.kts` file
 * header for why this is a deliberately separate, simpler function from
 * [computeVickreySettlement] (that one apportions a second price across MULTIPLE simultaneous
 * winning ballots in a basket vote; an auction has exactly ONE winning slot, no apportionment
 * needed). Pure function, no DB access -- the single most manipulation-sensitive piece of this
 * wave (a bug here directly changes who wins an auction and/or what they pay), exhaustively
 * property-tested via `AuctionOutcomeTest`.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. If [bids] is empty, the result is entirely `null`/`0` -- no leader, no price.
 * 2. Otherwise the LEADER is the bid with the strictly highest [AuctionBidView.maxBidLtr]. A tie
 *    at the highest maximum is broken by the EARLIEST [AuctionBidView.createdAt] (whoever reached
 *    that maximum first), then by the smallest [AuctionBidView.bidId] as a final, fully
 *    deterministic tie-break (extremely unlikely to ever matter in practice).
 * 3. `secondMax` is the highest [AuctionBidView.maxBidLtr] among every bid NOT placed by the
 *    leader (a leader's OWN other/earlier bids, if any survived as a distinct row, never count as
 *    competition against themselves -- moot in production since `auction_bid` holds at most one
 *    row per bidder, but this function does not rely on that invariant for its own correctness).
 * 4. [AuctionOutcome.currentPriceLtr] is [startingBidLtr] if there is no `secondMax` (an
 *    uncontested auction, the leader would pay only the floor), otherwise
 *    `min(leaderMaxBidLtr, secondMax + minIncrementLtr)`, floored again at [startingBidLtr] (a
 *    defensive floor -- unreachable in production, where every persisted bid is already validated
 *    `>= startingBidLtr` before it can reach this function, but this function makes no such
 *    assumption about its own [bids] input).
 *
 * Deterministic: the same [bids] input always produces the same [AuctionOutcome].
